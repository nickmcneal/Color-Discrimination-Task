# Dynamic-Stimulus-Task

## Progress

* Randomly selected colors chosen and displayed on a JavaScript Canvas each run
* Written code to determine total value of left and right sides by summing color values (currently logs in console)
* Randomly determines order of values for colors



## Needed Changes

* Need to add jsPsych (so that keyboard response goes to next trial, currently fixed at one combination per refresh)
* Canvases currently fixed in absolute positioning (not easily flexible to change size)
* Fixation cross, instructions, training, etc.
